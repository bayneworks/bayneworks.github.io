        <p class="h4">Due to the effects of COVID-19, the entirety of the appliance industry is experiencing a supply chain interruption.  Regional Distribution and Manufacturing inventory quantities    are exhausted and not projected to return to pre-COVID levels until early 2021.  As a result, product backorders are to be expected with longer than usual wait times experienced.</p>

          <p>The supply chain challenges our industry is experiencing are due to many significant factors, all stemming from COVID-19.  An example of the issue occurs when a positive COVID test causes the random closing of a manufacturing facility, which in most cases, can last for up to two weeks.  These unexpected closures cause significant delays affecting the entire distribution channel and, ultimately, end-customer delivery.</p>
          <p>Another factor in the supply chain challenge is the impact COVID-19 has on product shipping.  The pandemic is affecting the ability of the freight carriers nationwide to maintain an adequate workforce that can deliver products to the regional distribution points, and the dealer networks they service.  We are and will continue to experience random freight delays that occur without notice. </p>

          <p>Bayne HomeWorks understands and sincerely appreciates the patience and understanding of our customers during this unique and challenging point in time.  We have created a password-protected web page giving those customers (who have a pending order) the ability to check on the status of their items.  </p>
          <p>We update product status each day and post changes before noon CST.  </p>
          <p>When the manufacturer notifies us of an item status change, our Bayne HomeWorks logistics team will send the customer both a text and an email message alerting them of the update. </p>

          <p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>
          <p><u>What if I want to cancel?</u></p>
          <p>We understand the wait can be longer than you care to experience.  Should you wish to cancel, please notify your salesperson, and a credit will be processed.  </p>
          <p><strong>PLEASE KNOW:</strong> Once an order is canceled, we vacate the item with the respective brand that day.  Any attempt to reorder will, in all likelihood, result in a longer wait time than initially projected. </p>
          <p><strong>WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND:</strong> Should you experience a longer than acceptable wait and elect to locate the product or select a different item from another source, please do not cancel your order with Bayne HomeWorks until you have confidence any new order can be delivered on time.  </p>
